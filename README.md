# Next.js Template

> My personal [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) template used for starting other projects.

At first, it won't be much different than using [npx create-next-app](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/packages/create-next-app) - however I will continue to maintain this repo, adding features and configurations that meet my personal preferences.
